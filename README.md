# Project-1-MLB-statistics-website
A website for obtaining baseball player statistics.

Our site was originally going to contain all 4 main American sports (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL) but, we decided to stick with one sport being the MLB.

When you enter a player from any team who is either a pitcher or a hitter
Then their stats will appear by Player ID
When you enter a player who is neither a hitter or a pitcher
Then the result will not show by Player ID

The site is compatible with most devices. The code automatically keeps the stats and information up to date.

The code contains IDs of players from the entire Major League. 

It will record their batting average, as well as their pitching ERA.

The player information will display the athletes date of birth as well as the players hometown. It will also include their height and weight which will also be up to date.
