# Project-1-MLB-statistics-website
A website for obtaining baseball player statistics.

Our site was originally going to contain all 4 main American sports (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL) but, we decided to stick with one sport being the MLB.

When you enter a player from any team who is either a pitcher or a hitter
Then their stats will appear by Player ID
When you enter a player who is neither a hitter or a pitcher
Then the result will not show by Player ID

The site is compatible with most devices. The code automatically keeps the stats and information up to date.
